# pyOpTools

pyOpTools is a set of packages that allow the simulation of optical systems by raytracing as well as some calculations involving wavefronts, currently under development. It is written in Python and Cython, and is being developed by the technological development group of Combusti√≥n Ingenieros S.A.S, and the applied optics group of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

The pyOpTools is divided in several packages that contain the different library's functionalities:

    pyoptools.raytrace

This package contains the classes and functions used to perform the simulation of optical systems using 3D non-sequential raytracing algorithms. 

    pyoptools.misc

This package contains miscellaneous classes and functions used by the other packages, but that can not be classified in any of them. 


## How to install

We have created a virtualbox image of a debian 8 installation with the pyoptools running. This image can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6vN2VIpMQ48THUwX1NJSjM0cEE

This is to help people interested in testing this tool, while the documentation and installation instructions get updated.


For Debian/Ubuntu based distro we provide debs packages in the debs folder. You
can also create the deb file by running 'make deb' in the root directory of pyOpTools.

For development `sudo python setup.py develop` this will install systemwide from current directory, making changes to the *py files directly availables.

## Requirements

The following steps work to install the packages required to run pyoptools in
an ipython notebook under debian 8. This instructions are far from complete, 
but they will give an idea

1. Install stdeb. in https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.8.5#install-or-using-stdeb-to-create-an-stdeb-installer you can find instructions on how to do it
2. Install ipython: sudo pypi-install ipython --release 3.2.1 (had problems with the latest one)
3. sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
4. sudo pypi-install backports.ssl_match_hostname
5. sudo pypi-install certifi
6. sudo pypi-install tornado
7. sudo apt-get install python-jsonschema
8. sudo apt-get install libosmesa6
9. sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk3.0
10. sudo pypi-install PyOpenGL --release 3.1.0
