# pyOpTools

pyOpTools is a set of packages that allow the simulation of optical systems by raytracing as well as some calculations involving wavefronts, currently under development. It is written in Python and Cython, and is being developed by the technological development group of Combusti√≥n Ingenieros S.A.S, and the applied optics group of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

The pyOpTools is divided in several packages that contain the different library's functionalities:

    pyoptools.raytrace

This package contains the classes and functions used to perform the simulation of optical systems using 3D non-sequential raytracing algorithms. 

    pyoptools.misc

This package contains miscellaneous classes and functions used by the other packages, but that can not be classified in any of them. 

## Requirements

The requirements are found in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file in the root of this repository. Please check
it and adapt to your current system setup to install PyOpTools requirements. If you choose to install PyOptools using 
the Anaconda Python distribution as noted in the `How to install` section below, you can skip this step.

### Inside a Python virtualenv

If you have setup already a Python virtualenv you could just install the requirements using the following command

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### For Debian/Ubuntu systems

The following steps work to install the packages required to run pyoptools in an ipython notebook under debian 8. These
instructions are far from complete, but they will give an idea.

1. Install stdeb. in 
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stdeb/0.8.5#install-or-using-stdeb-to-create-an-stdeb-installer you can find instructions 
on how to do it.
2. Install ipython: sudo pypi-install ipython --release 3.2.1 (had problems with the latest one)
3. sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
4. sudo pypi-install backports.ssl_match_hostname
5. sudo pypi-install certifi
6. sudo pypi-install tornado
7. sudo apt-get install python-jsonschema
8. sudo apt-get install libosmesa6
9. sudo apt-get install python-wxgtk3.0
10. sudo pypi-install PyOpenGL --release 3.1.0

**NOTE:** These instructions will only work for debian using stdeb, adapt accordingly for your platform/OS.

## How to install

Pyoptools can be installing using one of the ways described in the following subsections.
 
Please take into account that PyOpTools is being developed almost exclusively in Linux operating systems. We suggest 
using a *NIX operating system when using pyoptools. Anyways, Windows users can check the "Windows" subsection for 
instructions on building/installing pyoptools in MS Windows operating system.

This assumes you have cloned PyOpTools repository already.

### Anaconda environment (Recommended)
Probably the most portable and direct way of installing PyOpTools is to use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) 
python distribution. Once you have set up Anaconda you can create an environment for the PyOpTools software via the 
following command

    conda env create --file pyoptools_env.txt --name pyoptools
    
running it inside the directory where you cloned the PyOpTools repository, since the file [pyoptools_env.txt](pyoptools_env.txt)
is in the root of this repository.  

### Debian/Ubuntu
We develop pyoptools using almost debian/*buntu Linux distributions exclusively so this is the way that's most tested 
and have better chances of working. Once you have setup up your requirements (check requirements section above), to 
compile a deb package you just need to run:

    make deb

This will create a .deb installer file inside the `deb_dist` directory in your source root tree of pyoptools. Which you
can install using the command (with admin privileges), changing the version/release/platform accordingly:

    dpkg -i python-pyoptools_<version>-<release>_<platform>.deb

Using this method you will have control of versions installed via dpkg/APT package manager.

### PyPI install (using pip - advanced users)

**Note:** Windows users please check windows subsection. 

Pyoptools is hosted in the Python Package Index since Jul-17, therefore you can just use `pip` to install it via command
line with the following command

    pip install pyoptools
    
Please note that this may alter your system libs, it's recommended to use this inside a virtualenv python environment.

### Windows (using Cygwin)

So far the only success attempt at building and installing pyoptools is using Cygwin (check http://www.cygwin.com/). This is mainly because of some 
issues when dealing with Microsoft compiler/SDK tools. You need a working Cygwin setup with all the dependencies 
installed. A list of the Cygwin packages can be found here: https://gist.github.com/ijpulidos/47155ace496d8945b02846b1cfabec27

Other than the listed packages in the previous link you need to _manually_ install/upgrade some dependencies by running
the following pip commands (this setup uses python2):

    pip2 install -U pip
    pip2 install -U ipython jupyter scipy matplotlib

After that you might just clone the pyoptools repository by issuing the following command in a Cygwin terminal

    git clone https://github.com/cihologramas/pyoptools.git
    cd pyoptools
    python2 setup.py install
    
And you should be ready to use pyoptools in Windows inside your Cygwin environment if all went well.

### Virtual machine (Deprecated - old)

We have created a virtualbox image of a debian 8 installation with the pyoptools running. This image can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6vN2VIpMQ48THUwX1NJSjM0cEE
